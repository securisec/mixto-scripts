# mixto-cutter

This is a simple script to integrate mixto with cutter disassembler. 

## Install
Refer to [Cutter docs](https://cutter.re/docs/plugins.html#loading-and-overview) on how to load external extensions. 

## Usage
There are two ways to use this script. For either way to be successful, the *entry_id* needs to be set in the mixto tab widget. 

- Right click on the assembly to see various one click integrations
- Use the `mixto` tab widget to run r2/cutter commands and send the output to Mixto.
